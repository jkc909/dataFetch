My name is Joe Costello and thank you for joining us today

When I graduated from umass dartmouth in 2012 I joined Wayfair.com

I worked there as an analyst for 6 years, while there I was building web crawlers and managing the data from teh web crawlers using sql. 

We used third party software to build the crawlers, and through that I learned the art of development but I needed to learn the skills of coding. 

so I started building crawlers in python and from there I fell in love with coding.

Working with the data from the crawlers I built Match Maker

I scraped two online retailers for product data using python. I then compared the two sets of data to generate a list of potential product matches. My matching algorithem is not perfect so I need humans to review the matches

The best way to compare data is through a UI, so let's take a look at the Matching UI that I made

Users can compare two sets of data, they can click to expand and see more data points for a product, they can click links to the original product pages, and they can submit a comment with their review.

User can control the application through keyboard shortcuts

--------   on the user profile page, they can view previous submission and get manager feedback

<!--this UI is professional but who says work has to be boring? I slapped a new paint job on it and for every 10 matches you review you get a gif of a puppy or a kitten-->

I'd love to tell you more about my python scraping platform and matching algorithem, so let's chat more on that!

Thanks for listening.
